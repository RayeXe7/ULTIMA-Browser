# ULTIMA-Browser
I am creating a browser that will basically unblock everything on school laptops. I will hopefully complete it in around 1-3 days.

It won't nessesarily unblock everything but it will emulate Google Chrome, so pretty much everything will be unblocked on the browser. 

It will start off like a normal website with a free domain but if it gets blocked, use your personal device to copy the file and add it to a Google Site.

If Google Sites is blocked, tell me in "Issues", I will find a way.
