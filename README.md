# ULTIMA-Browser
I am creating a browser that will basically unblock everything on school laptops. I will hopefully complete it in around 1-3 days.

It won't nessesarily unblock everything but it will emulate Google Chrome, so pretty much everything will be unblocked on the browser. 

It will start off like a normal website with a free domain but if it gets blocked, use your personal device to copy the file and add it to a Google Site.

If Google Sites is blocked, tell me in "Issues", I will find a way. Maybe like bookmarklets or inspect menus.

Support list:

Chromebook (APK/HTML)

Windows Laptop (EXE/HTML)

I will make a new repo that will have a link to this one.

I haven't started the project but I will start in a few days or around the start of school. (August - December)

The project will probably take a few days or weeks.

Around the middle of the school year, I will start implementing disguises such as fake information websites and more.
